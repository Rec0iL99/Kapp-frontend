# Setup

## Prerequisites

Before running the project *locally* on your machine make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

* Latest version of [JavaSE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

## Installation

1. Update the libraries and sync the project (might take a minute).

2. If all the Gradle build succeeds, you can run the app on an emulator or your own Android device.

## Troubleshooting your local environment

Always `git pull` and get the latest from master. [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your friends. You can find answers for most technical problems there. If you run into problems you can't resolve, feel free to open an issue.
